Goal:  This homework will give you practice with singly-linked list.

Getting Started
---------------

This folder contain the classes SList and SListNode, which
implement a singly-linked list.  
You can 
1)  import and run in Eclipse,  or  
2) compile SList.java with "javac -g SList.java".     
   Run the test code with

    java SList

The main() method of SList includes test code, which can be used to help debug
the list code before SLists are used in other programs.

Read SList.java to find out what methods are available to help you modify
SLists.  Items in our SLists are indexed starting from 1, unlike Java arrays.

Part I:  Using SLists 
-------------------------------
In the main() method, construct a list that looks like:
    [ 6 9 12 ] 
and print the resulting list.

Add more lines to change this list to:
    [ 3 6 9 12 15 ] 
and print the resulting list.

Part II:  Adding to the End of a SList 
--------------------------------------------------
A method called insertEnd() exists, but it runs in linear time, because every
time it is called, it walks down the list to find the end.  Without changing
the meaning of this method or any other, modify the representation of a SList
and whatever methods are necessary to make insertEnd() run in constant time.
Your SList class will need to continually maintain a record of the last (tail)
SListNode in an SList, and all SList's methods will have to ensure that this
record stays current.
